## Cognitive level of questions

>  Specialty-level exam questions are not designed to solely test your recall of an AWS service. Instead, they challenge you to apply your knowledge of AWS services, features, and related concepts to a given scenario.

## Strategies

1. _Read and Understand the question first_.
2. _Identify the key phrases and qualifiers_.
3. _Try to answer the question before even looking at the answer choices_.
4. _Eliminate answer options based on key phrases and qualifiers_.
5. _Flag & move on as required. But remember to answer all the questions).

## Question Components

AWS specialty exam questions contain two components: scenario and question.

Scenario: This portion frames the situation on which the question is based. It lists services, problems, and requirements that will help you come to a correct response. You will always have all the information you need to identify the correct response. Do not try to add to or remove information from the scenario.

Question: The question always specifies the exact conditions that must be met. If more than one response is required, the question always specifies the number of required responses. If nothing is specified, there is only one correct response.
