# Security

## Tokenization

> Tokenization can be used to add a layer of explicit access controls to de-tokenization of individual data items, which can be used to implement and demonstrate least-privileged access to sensitive data. For instances where data may be co-mingled in a common repository such as a data lake, tokenization can help ensure that only those with the appropriate access can perform the de-tokenization process and reveal sensitive data.

## AWS Artifact

> AWS Artifact provides on-demand access to AWS' compliance and security related information. 

### Key characteristics: 

- Self-service document retrieval portal 
- Review, accept, and manage your agreements with AWS (such as the BAA and NDAs)
- Share evidence of AWS security controls by providing AWS artifact compliance documents to regulators and auditors 

## Compliance with AWS Config

> For example, you can use an AWS Config rule to monitor the settings of Amazon S3 bucket Access Control Lists (ACLs) and S3 bucket policies to look for public read or public write access violations.

## Amazon Macie

> Amazon Macie gives you an automated and low touch way to discover and classify your business data and detect sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) and credential data.
